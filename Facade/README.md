## Applicability

- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

## Pros and Cons
- You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
<br/><br/>  
- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
